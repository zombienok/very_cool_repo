Nothing should be ignored in this case, as the only modified file is a markdown document (`homeworks/HW07/report.md`), which is a source/config file and not a build artifact, dependency, or temporary file. According to rule #6, when the changes contain only source or config files with no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, the output should be empty.

Therefore, the optimized .gitignore content is:

```(empty)```
